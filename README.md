- 👋 Hi, I’m @jpgburgess, based in Bath, UK. I have a background in software development, run a business specialising in document data extraction and automation.
- 👀 I’m interested in "automating the shit out of everything" where everything is what my clients are after. :) I am not into comestic automation, IoT, etc - my focus is on delivering better data in business.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning AWS stack, always learning better use of C#, Py on the radar.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source tools for common data validation, e.g. NHS number validation (https://github.com/jpgburgess/NHSNumber-Validation), MRZ parsing and validation (work in progress, not open to all at the moment), OCR, image classification & data extraction, AWS, ABBYY software
- 📫 How to reach me https://drflow.co.uk
